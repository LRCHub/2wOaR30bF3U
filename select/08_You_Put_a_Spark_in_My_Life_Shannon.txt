You put a spark in my life
You turned me on, I'm so glad that I got you
You put a spark in my life
You know you are my love

Boy, the things you do to me
I just can't put in words, I can't describe this feeling
You became a part of me
The first day that I met you, I never will forget
You have given me so much more
The love and affection
I feel when you are near
I'm complete with your protection
Baby, it's you!

You put a spark in my life
You turned me on, I'm so glad that I got you
You put a spark in my life
You know you are my love

Ooh, I like this feeling
I like the way you move me, I like the way you soothe me
Baby (you turn me), you keep the fire burning
You keep me burning all night
Till the morning light comes
I can't express the joy of being by your side
How much I care for you, I never will deny
Baby, it's you!
