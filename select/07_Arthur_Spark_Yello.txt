Get, get
Go

Pleasure

Don't wanna turn that treasure into a revolution
I never open my heart to get more contribution

Get, get

Don't care

Get, get

I know you love me
Don't want to leave you
We gonna burn it
Don't wanna miss you now

I know you love me
Don't want to leave you
We gonna burn it
Don't wanna miss you now

Go

Pleasure

Don't wanna turn that treasure into a revolution
I never open my heart to get more contribution

Go

I know you love me
Don't want to leave you
We gonna burn it
Don't wanna miss you now

I know you love me
Don't want to leave you
We gonna burn it
Don't wanna miss you now
