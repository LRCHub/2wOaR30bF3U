Dream
Did you forget how to dream?
So angry it makes you wanna scream
Think you're voiceless and no one can hear you
But I am listening
Breathe
Allow yourself time to breathe
The sound of your breath is relief
And it's gets useless when no one can hear you
But I am listening
It's never dark in the deepest part of your heart
There's always a tiny spark no storm can blow out

Here in the centre of chaos and fear
Above the noise and sirens are no leaves
Like a friendly ghost always near ya
Someone's listening
It's never dark in the deepest part of your heart
There's always a tiny spark no storm can blow out
It's never dark in the deepest part of your heart
There's always a tiny spark
It's never dark in the deepest part of your heart
There's always a tiny spark no storm can blow out
